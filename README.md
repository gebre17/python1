JARVIS - **JOEL'S ARTIFICIAL REALISTIC VIRTUAL INTERNET SERVICE"**

There had been many different versions of my Jarvis in the past few months. First, it had been a text assistnat, then speech came and this version is my first every fully artificially intelligent jarvis program with AIML. This is completely written in Python and it is compatible with almost all systems (Mac OS, Linux and Windows(Recommended)). Being written in Windows, it is more suitable to be used in Windows. Some minor changes will be needed to run on other os.
